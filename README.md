# README.md Node.js Homework

---

# Intent/Purpose of Project

> ## This project is an attempt/demo to take the user input in order to create a productive README.md file. Not everything that's ever possible is in here, but it's a good basic guide.

---

# Instructions

> ## First, the user should open thier terminal(if you have VS code, the hotkey is ctrl + shift + `). Next, the user should type "npm i init". Init is used to set up a new or an existing npm package. From this command, the user has now downloaded the default packages to work with.
>
> ## _To see more documentation on this, then please visit [npm init documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)_
>
> ## Second, the user should do the appropriate research and aquire which packages would be appropriate to download for said project. For times sake, _I will provide the dependencies needed for this project._
>
> ## Dependiencies Needed: fs, inquirer, and markdown-it

# Instructions - Example

> ## Step 1 - Install the initializer from the first link I provided (line: 20).

```
npm i init
```

> ## Step 2 - Once all the default modules are downloaded from step one, then go to the following links to download the next modules for this project.

1.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs - This URL provides the _FS_ module package.
    ![Example:1](pictures\fs-instructions.JPG)
2.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer - This URL provides the _inquirer_ module package.
    ![Example:2](pictures\inquer-example.JPG)
3.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it - This URL provides the _markdown-it_ module package.
    ![Example:3](pictures\markdownit-instructions.JPG)

> ## Step 3 - Examples on how these NPM's are implimented.
>
> ## FS Module Example:

```
npm i fs || np install fs
```

> ## inquirer Module Example:

```
npm i inquirer || npm install inquirer
```

> ## markdown-it Module Example:

```
npm i markdown-it || npm install markdown-it
```

> ## Step 4 - To start creating your README.md file, create a 'index.js' file. Next the example provided below will show how to call these modules into your 'index.js' file.

```
const fs = require("fs");
const inquirer = require("inquirer");
let md = require("markdown-it")();
```

> ## Step 5 - Create the input on the desired outcome that's desired.
>
> ## Step 6 - TESTING and FINALIZING your README.md : Once your arguments have been set up, along with completing step four, then you can proceed to check and complete your README.md by typing the code below :

```
node index || node index.js
```
