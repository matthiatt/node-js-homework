# README.md Node.js Homework
## This project is an attempt/demo to take the user input in order to create a productive README.md file. Not everything that's ever possible is in here, but it's a good basic guide.
## clone the code from your package once npm init and npm i, are both ran. go to the repo, install the dependancies you want by inputting npm i - then followed by the name of the dependancy you wish to install.  Then to test, run the command - node index.
## no licenses were used.
## just to answer the questions I provided for this homework-demo to give a good example of how a READEME.md file should look like.

# README.md Homework Demo
## This is a node.js application that was made as a demo to show how a user can input data/characters in order to create a README.md file.  Also to show the user the main topics a good README.md should cover.
## To install, all you must do is clone the code into the repo that was created. Then install the dependences within that repo with 'npm i' command in the termanal by pressing => ctrl + shift + tick-mark (next to the 1 key).  Then run the program with the command 'node index.js' or even 'node index'.
